# bxcr-bamboobxcr bamboo is a vagrant/chef setup for a CI/CD demo using Atlassian Bamboo. It can be easily used in conjunction with the Apprenda [bxcr](http://github.com/apprenda/bxcr) environment. This is a fork of the original  [bxcr](http://github.com/apprenda/bxcr) with the addition of the bamboo box. The original documentation for  [bxcr](http://github.com/apprenda/bxcr) has been moved to another (readme)[./bxcr_orig.md]# bxcrbxcr is a small Apprenda Cloud Platform environment that can be brought up using Vagrant.## PrerequisitesThese are the versions this has been tested on, but it _should_ work with any recent version of Vagrant and VirtualBox* Vagrant 1.9.6* VirtualBox 5.1.22You should have at least *16 GB* of RAM available to run these boxes.## Usage1. Clone this repository.2. Run `vagrant up` from the root of the code checkout. If this is your first time running it, it may take some time as Vagrant must pull a few gigabytes of base images.3. To add a Linux node to your Apprenda Cloud, run `vagrant up apprenda-linux`.4. To add a Kubernetes cluster to your Apprenda Cloud, run `vagrant up apprenda-k8s`.5. Add entries to your system hosts file to enable you to access the VM by name:  ```172.16.0.10     apprenda.bxcr172.16.0.10     www.apprenda.bxcr172.16.0.10     apps.apprenda.bxcr```6. Log on to your new instance at `https://apps.apprenda.bxcr`. The default account is `bxcr@apprenda.com` with a password of `password`.## Notes* "Why did Chef randomly fail to install something on Windows?" Let us know the details, but you can generally re-run the provisioning step with `vagrant provision` to retry.* To avoid your browser complaining about no trust, you can install `/certs/root.cer` into your system store.* For information on how to use Apprenda, please see our documentation at https://docs.apprenda.com. * Information on using Vagrant can be found at https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/index.html.* You can SSH to either the Windows or Linux machine by using `vagrant ssh` and the machine name, for example, `vagrant ssh apprenda-windows` or `vagrant ssh apprenda-linux`. For a graphical session, you can `vagrant rdp apprenda-windows`. The machine username and password for both nodes is `vagrant`.## Questions or Problems?Please file a GitHub issue for any questions you may have, or problems you encounter using `bxcr`.## ContributingWe gladly accept pull requests! Requests will be reviewed by our team. We encourage you to use this as a base for further automation with your own ACP installs.
